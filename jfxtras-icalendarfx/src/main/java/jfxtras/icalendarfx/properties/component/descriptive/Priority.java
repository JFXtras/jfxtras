/**
 * PRIORITY
 * RFC 5545 iCalendar 3.8.1.9. page 89
 * 
 * This property defines the relative priority for a calendar component.
 * 
 * A value of 0 specifies an undefined priority.  A value of 1
 * is the highest priority.  A value of 2 is the second highest
 * priority.  Subsequent numbers specify a decreasing ordinal
 * priority.  A value of 9 is the lowest priority.
 *     
 * Example:
 * The following is an example of a property with the highest priority:
 * PRIORITY:1
 *  
 * @author David Bal
 * 
 * The property can be specified in following components:

 * @see VTodo
