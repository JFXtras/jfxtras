	/**
	 * This method prepares a day for being drawn.
	 * The appointments within one day might overlap, this method will create a data structure so it is clear how these overlapping appointments should be drawn.
	 * All appointments in one day are process based on their start time; earliest first, and if there are more with the same start time, longest duration first.
	 * The appointments are then place onto (parallel) tracks; an appointment initially is placed in track 0. 
	 * But if there is already an (partially overlapping) appointment there, then the appointment is moved to track 1. 
	 * Unless there also is an appointment already in that track 1, then the next track is tried, and so forth, until a free track is found.
	 * For example (the letters are not the sequence in which the appointments are processed, they're just for identifying them):
	 * 
	 *  tracks
	 *  0 1 2 3
	 *  -------
	 *  . . . .
	 *  . . . .
	 *  A . . .
	 *  A B C .
	 *  A B C D
	 *  A B . D
	 *  A . . D
	 *  A E . D
	 *  A . . D
	 *  . . . D
	 *  . . . D
	 *  F . . D
	 *  F H . D 
	 *  . . . .
	 *  G . . . 
	 *  . . . .
	 * 
	 * Appointment A was rendered first and put into track 0 and its start time.
	 * Then appointment B was added, initially it was put in track 0, but appointment A already uses the that slot, so B was moved into track 1.
	 * C moved from track 0, conflicting with A, to track 1, conflicting with B, and ended up in track 2. And so forth.
	 * F and H show that even though D overlaps them, they could perfectly be placed in lower tracks.
	 * 
	 * A cluster of appointments always starts with a free standing appointment in track 0, for example A or G, such appointment is called the cluster owner.
	 * When the next appointment is added to the tracks, and finds that it cannot be put in track 0, it will be added as a member to the cluster represented by the appointment in track 0.
	 * Special attention must be paid to an appointment that is placed in track 0, but is linked to a cluster by a earlier appointment in a higher track; such an appointment is not the cluster owner.
	 * In the example above, F is linked through D to the cluster owned by A. So F is not a cluster owner, but a member of the cluster owned by A.
	 * And appointment H through F is also part of the cluster owned by A.  
	 * G finally starts a new cluster.
	 * The cluster owner knows all members and how many tracks there are, each member knows in what track it is and has a direct link to the cluster owner. 
	 *  
	 * When rendering the appointments above, parallel appointments are rendered narrower & indented, so appointments partially overlap and the left side of an appointment is always visible to the user.
	 * In the example above the single appointment G is rendered full width, while for example A, B, C and D are overlapping.
	 * F and H are drawn in the same dimensions as A and B in order to allow D to overlap then.
	 * The size and amount of indentation depends on the number of appointments that are rendered next to each other.
	 * In order to compute its location and size, each appointment needs to know:
	 * - its start and ending time,
	 * - its track number,
	 * - its total number of tracks,
	 * - and naturally the total width and height available to draw the day.
