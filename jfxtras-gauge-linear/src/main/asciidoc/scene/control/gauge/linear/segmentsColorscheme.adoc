The CSS defines a number of default colorschemes for the segments, some of which already were shown in the examples.
These can be loaded into a scene using:
[source,java]
--
    scene.getStylesheets().add(LinearGauge.segmentColorschemeCSSPath());
--
 
The numeric suffix denotes the number of segments the colorschema is for.
